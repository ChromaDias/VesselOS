{"session_id":"0199f746-2bc5-7513-a5da-0bf9d982428a","ts":1760790266,"text":"CI Workflow, Architecture Documentation, and Release Automation for VesselOS Dev Research\nGitHub Actions CI: Running Tests and Audits on Push\n\nSetting up a continuous integration workflow ensures that every code push is validated by automated tests and system audits. To scaffold a GitHub Actions workflow for VesselOS Dev Research:\n\nCreate a workflow YAML (e.g. .github/workflows/ci.yml): Configure it to trigger on push events (all branches or specific branches as needed)\nGitHub\n. For example:\n\nname: CI - Tests and Audits  \non: [push]  \njobs:  \n  build-test:  \n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest  \n    steps:\n      ... \n\n\nThis ensures the workflow runs for every push to the repository.\n\nSet up the environment: Use the official actions to check out code and install dependencies. For example, include steps for using actions/checkout@v4 and setting up Python with actions/setup-python@v5 (the project uses Python 3.12)\nGitHub\n. Then install required packages:\n\n- name: Install dependencies  \n  run: |  \n    python -m pip install --upgrade pip  \n    if [ -f requirements.txt ]; then pip install -r requirements.txt; fi  \n    if [ -f requirements-dev.txt ]; then pip install -r requirements-dev.txt; fi  \n\n\nThis mirrors the release workflow’s install steps\nGitHub\n. If the project also requires Node (for the Prime CLI or other tools), ensure Node is available (e.g. use actions/setup-node if needed).\n\nRun the test suite: Execute the Python tests with PyTest. For example:\n\n- name: Run unit tests  \n  run: python -m pytest -q  \n\n\nThe release workflow already includes this step to run all tests quietly\nGitHub\n. This will catch any failing unit tests on each push. If there are integration tests (like the collaborative smoke test), those can be included or separated into another job. (The existing collab-smoke.yml workflow runs a Docker-based integration test on push to main\nGitHub\nGitHub\n.)\n\nInclude Kira integrity audits: Incorporate the “audit” stage by running Kira’s built-in validation or test commands. Kira is responsible for chain integrity and coherence checks, and the documentation notes a TODO to wire kira test into CI\nGitHub\n. You can add a step to run Kira’s combined smoke test, for example:\n\n- name: Run Kira integrity tests  \n  run: python3 vesselos.py kira test  \n\n\nThe Kira agent’s CLI provides kira test to perform a validation plus encode/decode round-trip test\nGitHub\n. This ensures that beyond unit tests, the overall agent pipeline integrity is verified on each push. In the release pipeline, a Kira validation (kira validate) already runs to catch issues like broken ledger hashes\nGitHub\n, so extending CI with the full kira test adds extra coverage.\n\nRun full system audits (optional): For thoroughness, you could also run the audit CLI commands that check system health. The VesselOS CLI includes audit commands (e.g. python3 vesselos.py audit full) to perform a suite of health checks on the workspace (ledger consistency, persona states, etc.)\nGitHub\nGitHub\n. In CI, this might require seeding a test workspace (as in workspaces/example/) with initial state. If an example workspace exists (the quick start uses one named “example”\nGitHub\n), you can run:\n\n- name: Run audit checks  \n  run: python3 vesselos.py audit full --workspace example  \n\n\nThis will output a health summary across Garden, Echo, Limnus, and Kira components\nGitHub\n. It’s a good idea to include this to catch any integrity regressions (e.g. broken ledger chain, uninitialized state) early.\n\nFinalize and push: Once the YAML is configured with these steps, commit it to the repo. Pushing it to GitHub will activate the CI. On each future push, the workflow will install deps and run tests and audits, failing the build if anything is amiss. This safeguards the codebase by ensuring that every change maintains both functional tests and consistency checks.\n\nBy setting up this CI workflow, any broken tests or ledger integrity issues will be caught immediately on push, aligning with the project’s emphasis on rigorous validation (as seen in the release process)\nGitHub\nGitHub\n.\n\nArchitecture Summary in Markdown (Agents, Modules, Commands)\n\nCreating or updating a comprehensive ARCHITECTURE.md (or similar) is vital to document the system’s design for new contributors. The VesselOS Dev Research repository already contains rich documentation pieces; the goal is to unify these into a clear summary of the architecture, agents, and command interfaces:\n\nCore system components: Describe the major subsystems – Pipeline, Agents, Interface, CLI, Memory, and Workspaces – and their responsibilities. For example, the docs outline Core Areas such as the pipeline (enhanced dispatcher and intent parser), the agent implementations (Garden, Echo, Limnus, Kira), the interface glue code, the CLI commands, the vector memory store, and the workspace state/log structure\nGitHub\n. Summarize each of these in a few sentences so readers understand the moving parts of the system.\n\nAgent roles and commands: List each agent (Garden, Echo, Limnus, Kira) with its role in the “ritual” and its primary commands. The documentation plan provides a convenient summary of Agent Roles & Common Commands\nGitHub\n. For instance: Garden orchestrates stages and consent, Echo manages styled text and personas, Limnus handles memory and the hash-chained ledger, and Kira validates integrity and handles releases. Under each, enumerate the key CLI commands (e.g. Garden’s start, next, open, etc.; Echo’s summon, say, learn, etc.)\nGitHub\n. This gives the reader both a conceptual role and the practical interface for each agent.\n\nPipeline flow diagram: Include the high-level data flow of how input text moves through the system, invoking each agent in sequence and producing output. The release/docs plan already has an ASCII diagram showing:\n\ninput_text -> intent_parser -> EnhancedMRPDispatcher  \n    |-- Garden (stage, consent)  \n    |-- Echo (persona & styled_text)  \n    |-- Limnus (memory + ledger block)  \n    `-- Kira (integrity + coherence checks)  \n-> aggregated results -> voice log + state updates  \n\n\nThis illustrates the architecture in one view\nGitHub\n. Reproduce this diagram or an equivalent description in the ARCHITECTURE.md to cement understanding of the end-to-end flow.\n\nModule organization: It can help to reference how the code is organized in support of the above. For example, note that the core pipeline logic lives in pipeline/ (with files like dispatcher_enhanced.py and intent_parser.py)\nGitHub\n, the real agent implementations are in library_core/agents/ (each agent’s logic)\nGitHub\n, and the CLI entry point is vesselos.py along with the cli/ package for command handling\nGitHub\n. You might not list every file, but pointing out where major functionalities reside (perhaps in a brief list) helps readers navigate the repository structure. The existing docs/REPO_INDEX.md provides a file map that can be used as a reference\nGitHub\nGitHub\n.\n\nTie in existing docs: Since the project already has documentation like IN_DEV_SPECS.md with deep-dives and an Agents index, ensure that ARCHITECTURE.md complements rather than duplicates them. You can link out to those for detailed topics. For example, mention that “for a more detailed specification of command flows and state contracts, see docs/IN_DEV_SPECS.md”\nGitHub\n. This way, the architecture summary stays high-level and the reader knows where to find more info. Also, if an AGENTS.md (agent pipeline guidelines) exists or is planned\nGitHub\n, incorporate its content or reference it.\n\nBy gathering the above into a single docs/ARCHITECTURE.md file, the repository gains a go-to overview. It should present what the system’s components are, how they interact, and how one uses the CLI to invoke the various agent behaviors. This makes onboarding easier and ensures that knowledge about modules and commands is captured in one place, staying up-to-date with the codebase\nGitHub\n.\n\nAutomating Release Documentation (Codex Instructions or CLI Tool)\n\nTo streamline the creation of release notes and documentation at each version, we can leverage both the repository data and VesselOS’s own tooling. The goal is to automatically compile release documentation from repo files, ensuring that each release is accompanied by up-to-date info (changelogs, knowledge artifacts, etc.) without manual effort. Two complementary approaches can be considered:\n\nUse Kira’s built-in documentation generation: The Kira agent includes commands to generate documentation from the system’s knowledge base. In particular, kira codegen --docs will emit a knowledge documentation file (e.g. docs/kira_knowledge.md) and --types can output updated TypeScript definitions\nGitHub\nGitHub\n. Incorporating this into the release process means you can automatically produce an updated knowledge doc summarizing what the system “knows” or the current state of important data structures. For example, as part of a release script or workflow, run:\n\npython3 vesselos.py kira codegen --docs\n\n\nThis could update docs/kira_knowledge.md with the latest aggregated knowledge from Limnus (tags, counts, etc.) just before publishing. Including such artifacts in the release ensures that anyone can see the internal knowledge state accompanying that release. The existing release action already packages a ledger export and changelog via kira publish\nGitHub\n, so adding the knowledge doc (perhaps by using --asset docs/kira_knowledge.md in the publish command or configuring the workflow) would bundle this extra documentation.\n\nDevelop a CLI tool or script to gather changes: Another strategy is writing a small Python or Node script that assembles release notes from repository files and history. This script can, for instance, parse the Git commit log since the last tag to extract notable changes, or scan specific directories for updates. The repository provides a machine-readable index of files (docs/REPO_INDEX.json lists all files with metadata)\nGitHub\n that the tool could use to detect new or modified docs/modules. For example, the script could find all markdown files in docs/ or important config files that changed in this release and compile their diffs or key points. It might also read a CHANGELOG.md template or use commit messages following a convention to build human-readable release notes. Because this is a research-focused repo, you could even integrate the audit logs or ledger to highlight any significant state changes. The key is that running this tool (manually or in CI) before a release tag will generate a Markdown summary of changes, new features, and any necessary upgrade notes. This summary can then be committed or attached to the GitHub release.\n\nCodex-compatible instruction set: Given the project’s integration of AI assistance (the mention of a “Codex” CLI suggests an AI that can follow instructions), you can formulate a prompt or instruction sequence for an AI agent to draft release documentation. For example, an instruction set could be: “Read through the repository index and the commit history since version X.Y.Z. Summarize the changes in each agent’s capabilities and any new commands introduced. List any new files in docs/ or changes in pipeline/ and library_core/agents/. Draft a release note in Markdown that highlights these updates.” Such a prompt, fed to an AI like OpenAI Codex or GPT-4, could automatically produce a first draft of the release notes, which you can then refine\nGitHub\nGitHub\n. The AI would effectively use the structured data (file list, commit messages, etc.) to generate human-friendly documentation. This approach might be integrated into the development workflow – for instance, a command like codex release-notes generate that uses an AI backend to output a markdown changelog for the new release.\n\nBy implementing one or a mix of these approaches, the “release documentation” process becomes much easier and less error-prone. The Kira publish mechanism already attaches a changelog and ledger export to releases\nGitHub\n, so extending it to include an auto-generated ARCHITECTURE or CHANGELOG markdown is natural. Whether through an AI-powered instruction set or a deterministic script, automating release docs ensures that every version tag comes with a consistent, comprehensive description of what’s in the release. This not only saves time but also keeps documentation in sync with the code – a key goal for VesselOS’s integrity and transparency in research contexts.\n\nOverall, these steps strengthen the development workflow: a robust CI pipeline guards against regressions, an updated architecture doc educates collaborators, and automated release notes keep everyone informed of progress. Each piece reinforces the project’s emphasis on coherence between the code, its documentation, and its distributed knowledge base."}
